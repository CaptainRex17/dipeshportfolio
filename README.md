# Dipesh Malhotra Portfolio
I made this portfolio using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. 
Always include "<!doctype html>" at the very beginning as it tells the
browser that the file is an html file.


## Bootstrap 

Bootstrap is mainly used for the navigation bar and the footer in this code.
I had to include Javascript and Jquery because those are requirements for 
bootstrap to run correctly.


##### For the social media icons I include the used font-awesome stylesheet.
