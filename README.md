# Dipesh Malhotra Portfolio
I made this portfolio using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. 
Always include "<!doctype html>" at the very beginning as it tells the browser that the file is an html file.


## Bootstrap ##

Bootstrap is mainly used for the navigation bar and the footer in this code.



For the social media icons I have used font-awesome.
